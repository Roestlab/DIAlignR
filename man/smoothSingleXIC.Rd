\title{Smooth chromatogram signal}
\usage{
smoothSingleXIC(chromatogram, type, samplingTime = NULL,
  kernelLen = NULL, polyOrd = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{chromatogram}{(dataframe) A dataframe of two columns. First column must always be
monotonically increasing.}

\item{type}{(char) must be either sgolay, boxcar, gaussian, loess or none.}

\item{samplingTime}{(numeric) Time difference between neighboring points.}

\item{kernelLen}{(integer) Number of data-points to consider in the kernel.}

\item{polyOrd}{(integer) Order of the polynomial to be fit in the kernel.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with two columns.
}
\description{
Smoothing methods are Savitzky-Golay, Boxcar, Gaussian kernel and LOESS. Savitzky-Golay smoothing
is good at preserving peak-shape compared to gaussian and boxcar smoothing. However, it assumes
equidistant points that fortunately is the case for DIA data. This requires a quadratic memory
to store the fit and slower than other smoothing methods.

\examples{
data("XIC_QFNNTDIVLLEDFQK_3_DIAlignR")
chrom <- XIC_QFNNTDIVLLEDFQK_3_DIAlignR[["run0"]][["14299_QFNNTDIVLLEDFQK/3"]][[1]]
newChrom <- smoothSingleXIC(chrom, type = "sgolay", samplingTime = 3.42, kernelLen = 9,
 polyOrd = 3)
