Description: To obtain unbiased proteome coverage from a biological sample, mass-spectrometer is operated in 
    Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) mode. Alignment of these DIA runs establishes consistency 
    and less missing values in complete data-matrix. This package implements dynamic programming with
    affine gap penalty based approach for pair-wise alignment of analytes. A hybrid approach of global
    alignment (through MS2 features) and local alignment (with MS2 chromatograms) is implemented in this tool.
