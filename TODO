Item 1 : Kernel based similarity https://abibuilder.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/archive/openms/Documentation/nightly/html/classOpenSwath_1_1MRMScoring.html
Item 2 : Gap penalty zero case
Item 4 : Multiple parameterised query SQL.
Item 5 : BigMemory package and parallel processing package
Item 8 : Divide by 64 nodes
Item 9 : Read about FDR stuff.
Item 10 : Manual annotation: Fully supervised.
Item 11 : Multi-threading for each alignment.
Item 12 : Information content after alignment, Feature mapping.
Item 13 : MSnExp from MSnbase for fast-access. Accessing using C++, however MSDataFile function (https://github.com/sneumann/mzR/blob/master/src/pwiz/data/msdata/MSDataFile.hpp) is slow for some reason.
Item 14 : Look into rOpenSci, software peer-review. https://ropensci.org/software-review/ . https://devguide.ropensci.org/
Item 15 : Remove pipes, they are slow. Fix x-axis in plot of aligned chromatogram
Item 18 : Plot retention time distribution. Score disctibution of alignment.
Item 19: Number of points in area integration
Item 20: Use MS1 in alignment.
Item 21: Remove index from example data.
Item 22: Change Traceback to lower-case.
Item 23: Add similarity matrices of same multipeptide
Item 29: Travis for all three.  https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/master/.github/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml

# Change all times to reference time. We can not output Retention times then.
# Store XICs for the precursor
# Store aligned times.
# Get alignment rank for each feature. Add new feature if not present.
# Map retention time of all features from eXp to ref.
# Map reference peak boundaries from ref to eXp.

Fix sampling time in Smoothing.
Make sure ID matches in multipeptide and prec2ChromIndices.
smooth chromatogram and area calculation in vignette.
Param sanity check.
param silent in DPosition and chromatogramPeak
documentation of DIAlignPy

  If loess fails, resort to linear alignment.
Align only those where FDr is > 0.05, true false in refRun
Alignment rank = 1 and fdr < 0.01
Alignment rank = 1 and fdr > 0.01 and < 0.05 (precursor and run)
Add test for visualization.
parallelize execution (fetching chromatograms) over multiple threads.
Update reference only once. Look for wider chromatogram if aligned peak is outside.
Implement for alignType = "local" and "hybrid"
Make decoy == 0 in getFeaturesQuery
Convert from csv to tsv.
Add featureID as well.
Implement a function to requantify across all runs.
